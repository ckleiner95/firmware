# Gateworks Venice SBCs

## Building
From the root of the repository.

```console
./scripts/openmanet_setup.sh -i -b venice && make -j$(nproc) download && make -j$(nproc) v=sc
```

The output from the build will be located in `bin/targets/imx/cortexa53/`. You will want the image that has `squashfs` in the name.

## Installing OpenMANET on a Gateworks SBC
The image can be installed a few different ways.  If you already have OpenMANET on your Gateworks SBC, you can install it through the Web UI using the update firmware functionality.

### Initial Install on Gateworks SBC
If you have not already installed OpenMANET on a Gateworks SBC you will need a few things to easily install the image for the first time.

Gateworks does provide documentation for [Installing Firmware](https://trac.gateworks.com/wiki/venice/firmware).

After trying several different ways to install the firmware, here is the easiest method I have found.
#### Requirements
- [Gateworks JTAG Programmer](https://trac.gateworks.com/wiki/venice/firmware) (Only needed if you did not buy a full development kit)
- [USB-C Flash Drive](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09WB2NL8W)
- [USB-C Ethernet Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082K62S48) (Only needed for GW7500)
- Software for a Serial interface

**IMPORTANT**
Follow all instructions from Gateworks to [prevent a group loop](https://trac.gateworks.com/wiki/gettingstarted#Power) with your JTAG device

Steps to get a serial console (Linux/MacOS)
1. Connect your JTAG device to a USB port
2. Use [Gateworks Instructions](https://trac.gateworks.com/wiki/jtag_instructions#SerialConsoleAccessonLinux) for Serial Console
3. Copy the OpenMANET squashfs firmware from your host computer to the USB-C Flash drive
4. Plug the USB-C flash drive into the Gateworks SBC
5. Once a `screen` session is setup, plug your USB JTAG device into the Gateworks SBC.
6. Power on the Gateworks SBC
7. You should get information in the `screen` session similar to this

```console

```

8. Hit any key to stop the boot process and drop into the uboot terminal.
9. You will enter the follow command into the uboot terminal which will begin copying the firmware from the USB flash drive onto the Gateworks SBC
```
usb start && load usb 0:1 $loadaddr <name of flash image on the USBC Flash Drive> && gzwrite mmc $dev $loadaddr $filesize
```
10. Unplug the SBC from power
11. Plug in a USBC Ethernet Adapter
12. Power on the Gateworks SBC.  After the UBoot menu you will see the linux system starting up.
